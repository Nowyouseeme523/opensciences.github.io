# About the Data

## Overview of Data

This paper provided the complete raw and processed data for the controlled experiment for the empirical evaluation of a 3D software visualization approach based on a city metaphor and implemented in a tool called CodeCity. This includes and is not limited to the pre-experiment, in-experiment and debriefing questionnaires, solution oracles and grading systems, correction scores and measured completion time.

## Paper Abstract

Software visualization is a popular program comprehension technique
used in the context of software maintenance, reverse engineering,
and software evolution analysis. While there is a broad range
of software visualization approaches, only few have been empirically
evaluated. This is detrimental to the acceptance of software
visualization in both the academic and the industrial world.
We present a controlled experiment for the empirical evaluation
of a 3D software visualization approach based on a city metaphor
and implemented in a tool called CodeCity. The goal is to provide
experimental evidence of the viability of our approach in the context
of program comprehension by having subjects perform tasks related
to program comprehension. We designed our experiment based on
lessons extracted from the current body of research. We conducted
the experiment in four locations across three countries, involving
41 participants from both academia and industry. The experiment
shows that CodeCity leads to a statistically significant increase in
terms of task correctness and decrease in task completion time. We
detail the experiment we performed, discuss its results and reflect
on the many lessons learned.
