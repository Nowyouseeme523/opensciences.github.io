# About the data

This dataset contains information on aging-related bugs found in two open-source projects (the Linux kernel and the MySQL DBMS). This dataset has been used to investigate defect prediction approaches for aging-related bugs, by using software complexity metrics and machine learning techniques. New software complexity metrics were proposed in this study to support defect prediction ("aging-related" metrics).

The dataset contains an ARFF file for each subsystem of the open-source projects. Each row of the ARFF file contains:

- The name of a file in the project;

- "Program size" metrics for the file (columns from 2 to 50);

- "McCabe's cyclomatic complexity" metrics for the file (columns from 51 to 68);

- "Halstead" metrics for the file (columns from 69 to 77);

- "Aging-related" metrics for the file (columns from 78 to 83);

- The number of aging-related bugs found in the file.
