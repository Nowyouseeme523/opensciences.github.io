## Paper Abstract
We are interested in re-engineering families of legacy applications towards
using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Is it worth to invest in harvesting
domain knowledge from the source code of legacy applications?

Reverse engineering domain knowledge from source code is sometimes
considered very hard or even impossible. Is it also difficult for "modern
legacy systems"? In this paper we select two open-source applications and
answer the following research questions: which parts of the domain are
implemented by the application, and how much can we manually recover from
the source code? To explore these questions, we compare manually recovered
domain models to a reference model extracted from domain literature, and
measured precision and recall.

The recovered models are accurate: they cover a significant part of the
reference model and they do not contain much junk. We conclude that domain
knowledge is recoverable from "modern legacy" code and therefore domain
model recovery can be a valuable component of a domain re-engineering
process.

## About the Data

This dataset contains multiple models:

+ A manually constructed domain model of the project planning domain based on
  the PMBOK guide
+ 4 manually constructed domain models of 2 project planning applications:
  + One is based on a manual read of all the source code
  + The other is based on manual full traversal of the UI

## Notes
The model is written as a Rascal-MPL ADT.
