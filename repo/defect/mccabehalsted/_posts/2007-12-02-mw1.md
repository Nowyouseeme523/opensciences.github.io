---- | ----
February 2, 2016 | Updating BibTeX, cleaning artifacts
Nov 2011 | Dataset has been cleaned by MartinShepperd et al. (mw1' and mw1'' are the cleaned versions)
December 2, 2007 | Donated by [Tim Menzies](/repo/people/data-donors/promise3.html)

# Notes from the Author

For more details on this data set, see [Shepperd | August 20th, 2011 at 7:12 am

Be aware that the Promise version of this dataset differs from the NASA MDP version:

Version,Cases(n),Features(p)
MW1 – NASA,403,43
MW1 – Promise,403,38

Therefore researchers are *strongly* advised to indicate which version of these files they are using!
