# Notes on the Data Set

This is a defect data set that contains Halstead and McCabe metrics:<br>
  * A tutorial on defect prediction can be found [here](/repo/defect/tut.html).<br>
  * Information about Halstead metrics can be found [here](/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/tut.html).<br>
  * Information about McCabe metrics can be found [here](/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/tut.html).<br>
