# About the Data

## Overview of Data

Although the original Qualitas Corpus has provided a valuable contribution for experimentation in software engineering, there are several scenarios—e.g., experiments that rely on Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or bytecode—in which researchers need to import and compile the source code. Since this task is not trivial in the case of systems with many external dependencies, our goal is to assist researchers by removing the compilation effort when conducting empirical studies.

## Qualitas

The Qualitas Corpus is a curated collection of software systems intended to be used for empirical studies of code artefacts. The primary goal is to provide a resource that supports reproducible studies of software. The current release of the Corpus contains open-source Java software systems, often multiple versions.
